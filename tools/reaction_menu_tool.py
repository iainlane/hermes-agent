Reaction-Menu Tool — present_menu

Lets the agent present an interactive menu the user resolves by TAPPING a
reaction, rather than typing.  On Matrix the menu is a message with one seeded
emoji per option; tapping an emoji collapses the menu and injects the chosen
option's ``payload`` as the next user turn.  On platforms without reaction UIs
the base adapter renders a numbered text list and a bare-number reply resolves it.

Unlike ``clarify``, ``present_menu`` is **non-blocking and terminal for the turn**:
it presents the menu and returns immediately, ending the agent's turn.  The user
may tap now or much later — their tap starts a fresh turn through the normal
inbound path (queued behind any busy agent automatically).  Call it LAST.

The actual send + choreography lives in the platform layer (the gateway wires a
``present_menu`` callback in ``gateway/run.py`` that bridges to the adapter's
``send_reaction_menu``).  This module defines the schema, validation, and a thin
dispatcher that delegates to that callback.
