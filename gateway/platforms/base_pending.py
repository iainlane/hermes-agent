"""Pending attribution, dispatch ownership and withdrawal before a turn starts.

Before a message reaches the agent, it can wait in one of the adapter's buffers: a text batch, the
busy-text debounce buffer or the pending slot (with the runner's FIFO overflow behind the slot).
Buffers merge several messages into one event. ``merge_recorded`` records the parts of a merged
event, so that ``withdraw_from_event`` can rebuild it without one message by replaying the merges
of the remaining parts in their original order. The replay reuses each recorded merge function and
does not repeat the choice that selected it. A photo followed by two texts merges into one event
in the pending slot, and withdrawing the photo leaves one event with both texts, although the two
texts alone would have queued as two turns.

``PendingWithdrawalMixin`` declares the attributes that its host (``BasePlatformAdapter``)
provides.

No imports from ``gateway.platforms.base``: it imports this module.
