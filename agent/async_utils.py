"""Async/sync bridging helpers.

``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`` can raise ``RuntimeError`` (loop closed during a
shutdown race); the coroutine is then never awaited or closed, which triggers a
"coroutine was never awaited" RuntimeWarning and leaks its frame. The helpers here
close the coroutine on scheduling failure. ``future.result()`` failures are deliberately
NOT handled: once the loop accepts the coroutine its lifecycle belongs to the loop.
