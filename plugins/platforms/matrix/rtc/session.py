"""Maps MatrixRTC transcripts onto the room's gateway session.

The Matrix analogue of Discord's ``_voice_text_channels`` / ``_voice_sources`` pair
(``gateway/run_voice.py``). Discord needs two ids because a voice channel and the text
channel its transcripts land in are different objects; a Matrix call lives *in* the room
it is about, so the pair collapses to one map: ``room_id -> SessionSource``. A spoken
turn therefore arrives in exactly the session the room's typed messages already use —
same thread, same profile, same channel prompt — instead of a synthetic sibling.

Nothing here joins a call. Binding happens when something else joins one, which is the
``/voice join`` wiring's job.
